# social-share
Social Sharing Buttons
===============

Social Sharing template part and associated files for WordPress.

```custom-functions.php``` is a function you can put in your ```functions.php``` file. We just break ours out into a few different partials. The function itself adds meta tags to the header, and pulls in the title, description and image dynamically based on the post.

This plugin is based on one from [zenman](https://github.com/zenman), but using [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for icons over svgs.
